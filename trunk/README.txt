This program will ignore users and phrases in the game NavyFIELD.


To change the people who are ignored, simply edit the ignore_users.txt file.  Put one person per line.  This file may be empty.


In addition to ignoring people, certain phrases can be filtered out as well.  Like the users file, edit the ignore_phrases.txt file, and place one match per line.  The program accepts regular expressions.  See: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression



Both the ignore_users.txt and ignore_phrases.txt file can be edited at anytime.  Once you save either of them, the program will update itself.



Hope you enjoy.
